## Description:

Focus is an iOS mobile application that allows you to set financial goals and visually track them through incremental savings. 

User Summary:
1. Choose a goal and an area of your life that you can spend less on.
2. Enter your daily spending.
3. Monitor your progress.

General users will receive daily notifications to enter then savings input. Focus will calculate, display, and track the progress of the active goal based on initial goal information created. The aim of Focus is to keep the user focused on one active goal at a time. The user has the option to edit their initial goal settings or to focus on another more immediate goal instead. The following example portrays a user experience scenario.



## A day in the life of Jim:

Meet Jim!
Jim spends $10 a day on lunch. 
Jim really wants to buy his mom a $200 necklace for her birthday. 
He has 30 days to do it.

Jim is using Focus to calculate and track his daily spendings and savings to achieve his goal. Every day Jim will receive a notification on his phone that will remind him to input his savings until he can finally buy Mom that necklace. Every time Jim logs into the app, Focus will visually display his progress. When his goal is achieved, he can focus on another!



## Resources:

- Apple Local Push Notifications
- Core Data
- Firebase Authentication and Login
- Firebase Realtime Database

● App is free. ● The user will need to grant app permission to allow local push notifications to update daily savings and display progress. ● Firebase Authentication and Login via email and password input is used as a secure method (Google Firebase encryption) to store personal savings goals. ● All information is based on input and up to the personal discretion of the end-user. Information is stored locally on the user's personal device, and will also be stored online using Google Firebase Database as a back-up.


The current version of the app only includes markets in the New York City area, but with the help of our users, we hope to expand the list of markets to include cities all over the United States.
